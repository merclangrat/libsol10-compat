README

Solaris compatability library for supporting compilation of modern software.

libsol10-compat comes with pkg-config support.

If using without pkg-config, activating compatability support is a matter of
updating the include path and linking with the libsol10_compat library

CFLAGS+="-I/usr/local/include/libsol10-compat"
LDFLAGS+="-L/usr/local/lib -lsol10_compat"

For C++ code, open macro is not defined unless the LIBSOL10_COMPAT_ENABLE_MACROS
is defined to avoid issues with C++ classes having their open methods renamed.
